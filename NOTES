Reson S7K - mbsys_reson7k3.h

0) All record names changed to reflect only version 3 of the S7K format.

1) Updated the Record ID Definitions to reflect only version 3.

2) Version 2 tags (V2) were removed from names of identifier as the I/O is not backwards compatible and supports only version 3.

3) Definitions that no longer appear in version 3 of the S7K format and got removed:

/* 11000-11199 reserved for Payload Controller command records */
#define R7KHDRSIZE_7kPayloadControllerCommand 16
#define R7KHDRSIZE_7kPayloadControllerCommandAcknowledge 12
#define R7KHDRSIZE_7kPayloadControllerStatus 16

/* Edgetech trace data format definitions */
#define EDGETECH_TRACEFORMAT_ENVELOPE 0     /* 2 bytes/sample (unsigned) */
#define EDGETECH_TRACEFORMAT_ANALYTIC 1     /* 4 bytes/sample (I + Q) */
#define EDGETECH_TRACEFORMAT_RAW 2          /* 2 bytes/sample (signed) */
#define EDGETECH_TRACEFORMAT_REALANALYTIC 3 /* 2 bytes/sample (signed) */
#define EDGETECH_TRACEFORMAT_PIXEL 4        /* 2 bytes/sample (signed) */

4) Position (1003) header size changed from 36 to 37 bytes, but last byte is optional (number of satellites).

5) Survey Line (1014) header size changed from 16 to 72.

6) Added record size for data in Custom Attitude Information of 4 bytes.

#define R7KRDTSIZE_CustomAttitude 4

7) MatchFilter (7002) header size changed from 24 to 88.

8) ImageData (7011) header size changed from 20 to 56.

9) PingMotionData (7012) header size changed from 20 to 56.

10) DetectionSetup (7017) renamed to DetectionDataSetup.

11) BITERecordData (7021) header size changed from 136 to 130.

12) 7KCenterVersion (7022) renamed to SonarSourceVersion.

13) RawDetection (7027) renamed to RawDetectionData.

14) FileHeader (7200) header was split by Dave into 2 parts, a header (44 bytes) and data (272 bytes). Question is why? I don't know but there is already a data record.

15) Record 1003 also can use latitude and longitude in meters!

16) Record 1003 is not using optinal record "Number of Satellites".

17) Record 1005 also can use latitude and longitude in meters!

18) Record 1011 has now x, y, z rotations in radians instead of degrees.

19) I believe "Processed Sidescan" should be removed.
